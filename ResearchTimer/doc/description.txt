This addon keeps track of when research items will complete for all your characters.
It is similar to Ato's "Craft Research Timer", however it does a lot less.
The dialog isn't configurable and no, you can't move it.
No, it doesn't pop up alerts.  (Wykkyds' taskbar can help with this)

You pop it up for a look in game, plan and put it away.

What is does, it does well.
The list of upcoming research completions is sorted.
The soonest are on top.

It comes with a little viewer that can show the same information from your desktop, without having to start the game.
Sadly the viewer is not unicode compatible and non-english users may see confused text.
You can find an instruction on how to yous it in the /doc folder: "offline_use.txt"


To use:
/rt to open and close dialog  or create a keybinding.



The saved variables file is written with current information when you logout of that character.
